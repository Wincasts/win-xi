# Changelog

## 0.3

- Chat ABI 9 (564 bytes): the game's expanded-log tab strip and scrollbar measured as it draws them
  and, where the addon asks (ReplaceControls bits 1 tabs, 2 scrollbar, copied with a successful
  expanded capture), left undrawn, the addon drawing its own in their places. Each tab's screen
  bounds, normalized to the viewport, its channel (from the owner's tab sprites) and whether it was
  drawn chosen are published (TabFrame, TabCount, Tabs[12]); the scrollbar's bounds and its page
  rows, row count and rows above the view (ScrollFrame, ScrollRect, ScrollPage/Count/Top), read
  from the fields FullLog::Update writes, never written. SupportedMask bit 6.
- A fifth verified CALL site, the full log's call to its tab strip (thiscall, the filter on the stack,
  ret 4; the content Draw's own fixed bytes keep ecx the owner), in the same all-or-none group as the
  four control sites; the strip's GPU submissions, art and labels alike, are blocked while the addon
  draws its own, with the game's hit-tests and Square selection untouched. Measurement reads
  screen-space vertices only, as the clock's.
- `/uihook chat` says what is replaced, how many tabs were measured and the scrollbar's rows.
- chat.h's helpers are inline, so the controls test builds without unused-function warnings.

## 0.2

- Chat ABI 8 (232 bytes): capture validated theme colours with the expanded frame. Tint native
  tabs, row-selection highlight, cursor and scrollbar via four verified CALL sites, preserving
  positions/scale/flags, native fade alpha and all native input/selection behavior.
- Selected tabs use the actual native sprite; scrollbar colours are changed in a local draw-only
  copy, never in native state. Control hooks are optional/all-or-none; missing signatures leave
  controls native. Add argument-preservation/Wine fixtures and optional private-client verification.
- Expanded capture mode 2 replaces only the frame; a unique full-log content signature
  cross-checked against its vtable lets native tabs, text, cursor and scrollbar draw unchanged.
- Keep native expanded keyboard/controller/mouse selection and message actions; retain the frame
  skin on older pages and all native filters. Reject stale compact/expanded captures across boundaries.
- Expanded typography and exact geometry remain native. Requires the updated nativechat bridge;
  offline tests/build pass, live GPU/interaction validation remains pending.

- Add verified native clock and compass boundaries, sharing the existing capture/replay renderer.
- Add independent HUD ABI 6 (164 bytes), clock/compass capabilities, native weather readback, the game's clock text's place, its map grid and its icons' places, a move and a scale for its weather icons and a preview of all of them.
- Redirect Clock::Draw's three icon calls, measuring each icon and leaving undrawn those the addon draws its own of.
- Redirect Clock::Draw's one text call, so a clock replacement hides only the game's text and keeps its day and weather icons.
- `/uihook` lists the addons handing it something now, and what; `/uihook hud` reports what the clock replacement is drawn into.
- Preserve stock clock during compass replacement and stock compass during clock replacement.
- Honor native radar availability and clock enable/visibility without persistent state writes.
- Keep buff ABI 4 and party ABI 3 unchanged; party and HUD release-all calls are isolated.
- Add basic clock addon and winxi nativehud bridge. No compass addon/UI yet.
- Add C++/Wine fixtures, Lua bridge/presentation checks and optional private-client call-graph verification.
- Live clock/compass validation remains pending.

## 0.1

- Consolidate buffhook and partyhook into one modular plugin without changing their handoff formats.
